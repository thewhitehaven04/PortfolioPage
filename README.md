# Portfolio site
This is the repository of my personal portfolio, built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

This site is based on the [Nextfolio template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextfolio-a-simple-next-js-portfolio). 

The portfolio is inspired by [this design by](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1213010685692032886/simple-resume-portfolio) by [Victor Alvardo](https://www.figma.com/@victoralvarado)
